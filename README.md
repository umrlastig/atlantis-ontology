# ATLANTIS Ontology
This repository contains the files produced to create the ATLANTIS (coAsTaL mAritime NavigaTion InstructionS) Ontology using the [ATONTE Methodology](https://hal.science/hal-03954342) for ontology development from text and experts.

Under no circumstances should any part of this work be used for real-life navigation.

## Overview
The _Instructions nautiques_ are a series of books produced and published by the French Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service, the Shom. They describe the coastal maritime environment from the point of view of a boat and give crucial information on navigating in coastal waters and accessing ports. The ATLANTIS ontology has been developped to model the knowledge contained in these books.

An article that presents the ontology has been published: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03695242v1
