## Overview
The _Instructions nautiques_ are a series of French-language books produced and published by the French Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service, the Shom. They describe the coastal maritime environment from the point of view of a boat and give crucial information on navigating in coastal waters and accessing ports. The ATLANTIS ontology has been developped to model the knowledge contained in these books.

An article that presents the ontology has been published: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03695242v1
